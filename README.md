This is an overlay relative to prefix portage, which endavours to
facilitate the use of crossdev within a Gentoo prefix installation.

You might want this if you want to use Gentoo to build
cross-compilers as a regular user.

There are a good number of changes needed to fully resolve all the
issues that prevent this from working upstream.  This only resolves
some of them.

To use this, you'll need to install prefix portage as described
<FIXME>somewhere</FIXME>.  You'll then want to add a file to
layman's <FIXME>stuff somewhere</FIXME>.  Once that's done,
you'll need to <FIXME>drink a pint of lemur pee</FIXME>.
